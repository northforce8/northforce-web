## Key Concepts

### Capacity

Capacity represents the total amount of work that can be delivered under your agreement. It is measured in credits and allocated based on your contract terms.

### Credits

Credits are the standard unit for measuring work. They represent consultant time and effort, adjusted for the complexity of the work type. Your contract specifies a credit allocation, and work consumes credits as it is performed.

### Projects

Projects are distinct initiatives with defined objectives and timelines. Each project organizes work toward specific deliverables. Your engagement may include one or multiple concurrent projects.

### Utilization

Utilization indicates what percentage of your allocated capacity has been consumed. It helps you understand engagement progress and plan for future work.
