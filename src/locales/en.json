  "objections.title": "Common Questions",
  "objections.title_highlight": "Answered",
  "objections.subtitle": "We understand your concerns. Here are honest answers.",
  "objections.1.q": "It will be more expensive than hiring",
  "objections.1.a": "Hiring includes salary, social fees, vacation, overhead, and risk of wrong hire. With the hybrid model, you only pay for capacity actually used and can scale up and down without hidden costs.",
  "objections.2.q": "We want someone on-site in the team",
  "objections.2.a": "You get clear contact responsibility and a weekly process where we sit close to leadership and key people, but without carrying the full cost of a full-time position. Systems make work visible in dashboards, meeting notes, and results.",
  "objections.3.q": "We already have agencies and consultants",
  "objections.3.a": "That is why a model that holds everything together is needed. NorthForce does not replace everything overnight, but coordinates, prioritizes, and builds systems around what you already have.",
  "objections.4.q": "It sounds complex with six areas and tokens",
  "objections.4.a": "Under the surface, the model is advanced, but for you it is simple. You get a subscription plan, a clear weekly process, and tokens to use where pressure is greatest right now.",
  "objections.5.q": "We become too dependent on you",
  "objections.5.a": "The whole point is to reduce person dependency, not create a new one. We document processes, build systems, dashboards, and structure that you own. If we step out, the model, tools, and documentation remain.",
  "objections.6.q": "Can the effect really be measured?",
  "objections.6.a": "We always start with goals and metrics. Pipeline, cycle time, booked meetings, ROMI, CAC, organic traffic, ranking, response times in CRM. Every week we look at the numbers and what has changed.",
  "objections.7.q": "Leadership does not have time for another model",
  "objections.7.a": "The model is built to relieve leadership, not take more time. One steering meeting per week, short and focused, where we prepare decision basis in advance.",
  "objections.8.q": "Our employees will feel threatened",
  "objections.8.a": "We always go in with the logic to strengthen people, not replace them. Employees get clearer structure, better tools, and less chaos. Many experience it as a career boost.",
  "objections.9.q": "You cannot know our industry well enough",
  "objections.9.a": "You provide industry knowledge, we provide structure, systems, and working methods. The model is made to be industry-independent but goal-focused.",
  "objections.10.q": "Tokens sound like something complicated we will not manage",
  "objections.10.a": "Tokens are really just a way to make the effort clear. You know how much capacity exists, what it is used for, and what it costs. In practice, it works like hours or credits, but with better control.",
  "objections.11.q": "Subscriptions tie us up too much",
  "objections.11.a": "The subscription is adjusted for reality. You avoid long project agreements and heavy notice periods, but still get stability in the work.",
  "objections.12.q": "We have burned ourselves on consultants before",
  "objections.12.a": "Classic consulting logic is often point efforts without responsibility for the whole. The hybrid model is based on continuity, weekly process, systems, and measurable goals.",
  "objections.13.q": "How secure are our data and systems?",
  "objections.13.a": "We always work with established platforms, clear access rights, and documented processes. You own data and accounts, we help you structure everything so security, traceability, and compliance become easier.",
  "objections.14.q": "We want to own our systems ourselves",
  "objections.14.a": "You should. You own the platforms, licenses, and data. NorthForce helps with design, implementation, integration, and continuous improvement.",
  "objections.15.q": "We are too small for such an advanced model",
  "objections.15.a": "Smaller companies need structure even more, because every misstep is felt directly in the cash register. We can start at a lower level with focus on a few flows, then scale when effect comes.",
  "objections.16.q": "We are too large and complex",
  "objections.16.a": "The model is made for complex environments with multiple functions, markets, and teams. We start in one unit or business area, show results, and build from there.",
  "objections.17.q": "It becomes too much change at once",
  "objections.17.a": "We never work with \"big bang\". We prioritize some critical flows and win trust there first. With weekly cycles and small iterations, change becomes manageable.",
  "objections.18.q": "The board will not understand the model",
  "objections.18.a": "Boards care about risk, profitability, and predictability. The hybrid model is easy to translate into just that. Lower risk than hiring, better control of cost than projects, and clear metrics.",
  "objections.19.q": "What happens if you or NorthForce disappear?",
  "objections.19.a": "The model is not built on one person, but on documented processes, dashboards, accounts, and structure at your place. Everything we do is documented and owned by the company.",
  "objections.20.q": "AI and automation feel uncertain and \"hyped\"",
  "objections.20.a": "We use AI and automation where it provides concrete business value, not as a trend. It is about removing manual waste, providing better decision basis, and creating smoother flows in sales and marketing.",
